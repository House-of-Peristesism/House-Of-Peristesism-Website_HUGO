The base religion of the House of Peristesism can be read in its entirety with the [Pigeora](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ERGCVcqiqwroLsx7weR3s1__aUCkVloqXOzeY9VjAg/), the holy scriptures of the House.

It begins with the Scripture of Genesis, which says that the Lord Omnipigeon created the Universe and five children gods. The children gods created Earth and the life on it, and then created a multitude of other gods that created and govern all sorts of different things. Then, all of the gods create and give to Earth their heralds, called pigeons. Each god represents a different pigeon species and can deliver messages to followers of the House-- usually those who have been following for quite some time.

The Scriptures then go on to explain several stories that are important to the House of Peristesism and that teach important lessons. The scriptures tell their readers to be kind and compassionate to those who do not violate another personally, and to always greet pigeons respectfully with a special salute.
