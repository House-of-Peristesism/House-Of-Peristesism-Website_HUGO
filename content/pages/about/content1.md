The House of Peristesism (often informally called Peristesism) is a small religious group. We're based in the western US and have a miniscule amount of members. Many parts of the religion explain that pigeons are heralds of the gods and the story of creation. The House uses a collection of scriptures called the Pigeora, which you can find on our basic religious info page.
