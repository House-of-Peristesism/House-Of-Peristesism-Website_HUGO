One of the greatest parts about the House of Peristesism is that it's so easy to join. There's generally no criteria other than to accept our gods and the holy writings of the Pigeora and to become knowledgable about our ways, so educate yourself on our "Religion" page to get familiar with everything there is to know. There's no place you need to go, or paper you need to sign in order to become a member, so invite your friends and family to join as well!
